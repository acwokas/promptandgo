  E'When prompts fail, it''s rarely because the AI is "bad".\n\nIt''s usually because we''ve been unclear, impatient, or asked it to do three jobs at once.\n\nThe good news is that most prompting mistakes are easy to spot and even easier to fix once you know what to look for.\n\nHere are the big ones I see over and over.\n\n## Mistake 1: Asking vague questions\n\n"Write something about…"\n"Help me improve this…"\n\nThese aren''t prompts. They''re placeholders.\n\n**Fix:** Tell the AI what success looks like.\nWhat''s the output for? Who''s it for? What should it avoid?\n\n## Mistake 2: Overloading the prompt\n\nMore instructions do not equal better results.\n\nWhen everything is important, nothing is.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Prioritise the main task\n- Move secondary requests into a second prompt\n- Let the AI finish one job before starting the next\n\n## Mistake 3: Forgetting to assign a role\n\nWithout a role, the AI defaults to generic.\n\nThat''s why outputs often feel flat.\n\n**Fix:** Start with a clear role.\nEditor. Strategist. Teacher. Analyst. Copywriter.\n\nInstant upgrade.\n\n## Mistake 4: Reacting instead of refining\n\nPeople rewrite prompts from scratch far too often.\n\nThat''s like throwing away a good draft because of one weak paragraph.\n\n**Fix:** Add constraints instead of restarting.\n"Be more concise."\n"Remove buzzwords."\n"Use examples from retail."\n\nSmall changes. Big gains.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nGood prompting isn''t about clever phrasing. It''s about clear thinking. Once you fix the fundamentals, the tools suddenly feel much smarter.\n\n## Call to action\n\nIf you want prompts that already avoid these common mistakes, PromptAndGo''s library is designed with roles, constraints, and clarity baked in from the start.',
