  E'Most people think prompting is about wording.\n\nIt isn''t.\n\nIt''s about thinking clearly before you type anything at all.\n\nIf you ask fuzzy questions, you''ll get fuzzy answers. If you ask sharp, purposeful questions, the AI suddenly feels a lot more capable. Not because it changed, but because you did.\n\nHere''s how to build that skill properly.\n\n## Step 1: Stop asking "what", start asking "why"\n\n"What should I write?" is vague.\n"Why does this need to exist?" is useful.\n\nBefore you prompt, answer for yourself:\n\n- What decision will this output support?\n- What action should follow?\n- What would make this genuinely helpful?\n\nThen build the prompt around that.\n\n## Step 2: Turn curiosity into constraints\n\nGood prompts don''t ask the AI to explore everything. They box it in on purpose.\n\nInstead of:\n"Give me ideas for a campaign"\n\nTry:\n"Generate three campaign ideas optimised for speed to launch, low production cost, and internal stakeholder buy-in."\n\nSame curiosity. Much better signal.\n\n## Step 3: Ask for thinking, not just answers\n\nOne of the biggest upgrades is asking the AI to show its reasoning.\n\n- "Walk me through the trade-offs"\n- "List assumptions before giving recommendations"\n- "Explain what you''re prioritising and why"\n\nThis turns the output from content into insight.\n\n## Step 4: Treat prompting like a conversation, not a command\n\nStrong prompting is iterative. You''re allowed to respond, nudge, clarify, and refine.\n\nThat''s not failure. That''s how good thinking works.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nAI doesn''t replace thinking. It amplifies it. The better your questions, the more useful the amplification.\n\n## Now It''s Your Turn!\n\nIf you want prompts that already guide better thinking, not just faster output, explore PromptAndGo''s curated library. Every prompt is designed to help you ask better questions, not just get quicker answers.',
