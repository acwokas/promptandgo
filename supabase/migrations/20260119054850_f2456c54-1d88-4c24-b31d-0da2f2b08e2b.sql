  E'"Yeah… it''s fine."\n\nThat reaction is incredibly common with AI output. Not bad. Not great. Just… fine.\n\nThe problem isn''t the model. It''s that most prompts are designed to hit average.\n\nHere''s how to push past that plateau.\n\n## Step 1: Define what "better than fine" actually means\n\nBefore refining anything, ask:\n\n- More useful how?\n- More persuasive to whom?\n- More specific in what way?\n\nIf you can''t articulate this, the AI can''t guess it.\n\n## Step 2: Replace "improve this" with direction\n\n"Improve this" gives the AI nowhere to aim.\n\nTry:\n\n- "Make this more decisive"\n- "Reduce politeness, increase confidence"\n- "Optimise for senior stakeholders with limited time"\n\nDirection beats encouragement every time.\n\n## Step 3: Introduce contrast\n\nOne powerful trick is to ask for alternatives on purpose.\n\n- "Give me two opposing approaches"\n- "Write a conservative version and a bold version"\n- "Show me what not to do"\n\nContrast sharpens quality fast.\n\n## Step 4: Stop chasing perfection, chase usefulness\n\nGreat outputs are rarely perfect. They''re just fit for purpose.\n\nIf it helps you decide, ship, explain, or move forward, it''s doing its job.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nAI is very good at being acceptable. It only becomes exceptional when you force it to take a position.\n\n## Call to action\n\nPromptAndGo prompts are written to avoid "fine" by default. They include built-in direction, contrast, and constraints so you spend less time nudging and more time using the output.',
