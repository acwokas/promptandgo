  E'Most prompts don''t fail because the AI is weak.\n\nThey fail because the thinking behind them is messy.\n\nPeople jump straight to asking for answers when what they actually need is clarity. The result is predictable: generic outputs, surface-level advice, and responses that feel vaguely right but never quite useful.\n\n## Good prompts start with intent\n\nGood prompts don''t start with instructions. They start with intent.\n\nWhen someone types "help me decide" or "write this better," they''re often bundling five different problems into one sentence. The AI can respond, but it''s guessing which problem matters most. That''s why the output feels diluted.\n\nThe best results come when you slow down just enough to define the real job you want the AI to do.\n\n- Are you exploring options, or narrowing them?\n- Do you want ideas, or a decision?\n- Are you looking for reassurance, or a plan you can act on?\n\nThose distinctions matter more than clever wording.\n\n## Less context, more precision\n\nAnother common mistake is over-loading the prompt with background. Context helps, but only if it''s relevant. Long backstories often confuse the model rather than sharpen it. Precision beats completeness almost every time.\n\n## Aim for momentum, not perfection\n\nThere''s also a tendency to ask for "the best" answer. The best strategy. The best idea. The best plan. In reality, what most people need is the next sensible move, not a perfect one. Prompts that aim for momentum outperform prompts that aim for optimisation.\n\n## Design prompts backwards from outcomes\n\nAt PromptAndGo, we design prompts backwards from outcomes. What should change for the person after they use this? Clearer thinking. A decision made. Something shipped. A conversation unlocked.\n\nIf a prompt doesn''t lead to action, it''s just a thought experiment.\n\n## The real power of prompting\n\nThe real power of prompting isn''t in controlling the AI. It''s in forcing yourself to think clearly enough that the AI can be useful.\n\nThat''s when it stops sounding generic and starts sounding like leverage.',
